# gold
gold.krebsco.de is a simple file share which provides plugins for
firefox/chromium to rewrite referers.

# Installation:
copy the nginx config at etc/nginx/sites-available, edit before use

# Plugins
All krebsgold plugins are stored in /krebs/gold/affiliate/
For installation follow the instruction at /krebs/gold/affiliate/README.md

## Chromium
uses userscripts, a modified version of the fsf amazon userscript

## Affiliatefox
Affiliatefox is a dodgy plugin by some weird german dudes at
http://www.the-angelz.net . it may be removed in the future as the chromium
userscript also works for firefox+greasemonkey
