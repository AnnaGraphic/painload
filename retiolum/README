Retiolum Darknet Module for Krebs
========================

Enter the darknet with the help of tinc retiolum

Getting Started
-------------

as root:

    wget -O- http://tinc.krebsco.de | HOSTN=yourfavoritename sh

( or use curl)

Get the hosts
-------------

    wget http://euer.krebsco.de/retiolum/hosts.tar # for all the hosts
    wget http://euer.krebsco.de/retiolum/supernodes.tar # only for supernodes, (deploy on wrt routers for example)

Update your hosts file
----------------------

to resolve the krebs nodes in the darknet

    make -C krebs/retiolum update


Graphs
------

    # in the darknet
    firefox http://pigstarter/graphs/retiolum
    # in the internet,anonymous graphs
    firefox http://pigstarter.de/graphs/retiolum/

Other cool stuff
---------------
in bin/ there are some cool scripts which are partly needed and partly
totally unnecessary to work with retiolum.

As all the scripts are not too horribly long, be sure to use 
`cat bin/SCRIPTNAME` to get an understanding of what they do

besides that in scripts/ there are 3 more scripts which perform pretty
sophisticated tasks like finding instances via multicast or writing graphs
of the current retiolum network. Try them if you dare :)
