Retiolum Darknet Module for Krebs
========================

Enter the darknet with the help of tinc retiolum

Getting Started
-------------
to get you started, check out scripts/tinc_setup/README

1. the first step you will need to do is grab a binary copy of tinc via your
packet manager, build it yourself or place all your hope into the build
script of your distribution.
2. after doing that you might want to run the scripts/tinc_setup/install.sh
script to write all the configuration files and private/public keys.
This installation is somewhat interactive so be sure not to fuck shit up.

Other cool stuff
---------------
in bin/ there are some cool scripts which are partly needed and partly
totally unnecessary to work with retiolum.

As all the scripts are not too horribly long, be sure to use 
`cat bin/SCRIPTNAME` to get an understanding of what they do

besides that in scripts/ there are 3 more scripts which perform pretty
sophisticated tasks like finding instances via multicast or writing graphs
of the current retiolum network. Try them if you dare :)
