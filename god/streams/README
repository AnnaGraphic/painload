streams done right

deepmix,groovesalad and radiotux are now init.d scrips which can be
started and stopped.

scripts are dumped into /etc/init.d and groovesalad will be set as
default via update-rc.d

mplayer will be started in a tmux session either by creating a new
session or starting a new window inside the first existing one
