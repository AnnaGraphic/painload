# Tests in Painload
every subdir in // `should` contain a Makefile which supports 'make test'.
The exit code must be 0 if all tests went fine, not 1 if some tests of the
subdirectory fucked up.

//util //retiolum and //ship are currently using an asynchronous test runner
which outputs test results in TAP (test anything protocol) format. 

# Docker Tests
Some Tests are using docker as a container testing facility. These tests 
contain of a runner script for the make test command and a script which 
will be run in the docker container. 
For examples see //retiolum/t/docker/

# Continuous Integration
currently we are running CI with buildbot on http://cband:8010 . 
Configuration is in krebs:ci/buildbot .
