Use Case 1: Request update on Host
=================================

< user> bot: update
< bot> /whois user
< bot> /msg user [CHALLENGE]
< user> /msg bot [CHALLENGE-RESPONSE]
< bot> updating... 
< bot> now on rev XXXXX

Command Flow
----------------
The bot has a locally stored list of [trusted] hosts along with their public
key, preferably from the tinc/retiolum directory.

The bot encrypts a 1K Byte long message with the public key of the host
retrieved by the /whois command.

This challenge is sent to the user requesting the command via private message.
The user then decrpyts the message with its own private key and sends the
decrpyted message to the bot.

The bot then executes the requested command if the challenge is answered
correctly
