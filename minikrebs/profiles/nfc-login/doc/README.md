#  NFCGATE


The NFC-Gate is part of the [User Suppository](https://github.com/shackspace/user_suppository) infrastructure. It polls the attached nfc-connector for new cards and uses the UID of the card for trying to either log in or log out the user at the shack-infrastructure.

The nfcgate is a build for the MR3020, not the WR703 as it uses all the
available LEDs to display the status of the login.
