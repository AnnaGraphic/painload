Scoreboard
==========
a non-interactive gold logger/plotter

scoreboard contains a number of modules which do a number of things:
ati_temper: log temperature data of an ati_temper enabled host :
  see //gold/miner/bin/ati_temper
solidcoin : graph solidcoin informations
bitcoin   : s.a.

//gold/scoreboard/profile contains all the important paths and variables
which are sourced by the modules. In a new installation this file needs
to be customized. 

//gold/scoreboard/util/schedule_logger is the scheduler for generating
the graphs every 5 minutes.
